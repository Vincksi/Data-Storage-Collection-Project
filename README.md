# **Data Collection & Storage : Final Project**

The group project is the main assignment of this course. 
You will work in groups of three students to complete a small end-to-end data workflow: from collection to cleaning, storage, analysis, and communication of results. <br>
At the end, you will present your findings to the class.<br>
This is your chance to bring together concepts from the course in a practical, open-ended task.

## Objectives

• **Collection**: select or acquire a dataset (public/open or self-built).<br> 
• **Cleaning**: handle missing values, errors, and inconsistencies.<br> 
• **Storage**: choose a format and explain your choice.<br> 
• **Analysis**: compute descriptive statistics and extract insights.<br> 
• **Communication**: produce visualizations and a short written report.
