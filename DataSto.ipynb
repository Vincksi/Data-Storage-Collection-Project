    "- Clarity and reproducibility first: every step is explained and deterministic.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Dataset selection & scope\n",
    "- Source: Kaggle dataset “Public transport traffic data in France” ([link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gatandubuc/public-transport-traffic-data-in-france)).\n",
    "- We explicitly use only one file from the dataset: `Regularities_by_liaisons_Trains_France.csv`.\n",
    "- Rationale: this file contains service regularity information per liaison/line, which is directly relevant for understanding service levels and delays.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Provenance & reproducibility\n",
    "- We retrieve data programmatically using `kagglehub` to guarantee a deterministic path and versioned download.\n",
    "- We copy the CSV to a local `data/raw` folder to ensure a stable, project-local reference path for subsequent steps.\n",
    "- Ethical note: data is public/open; we will cite data source in the final report and respect licensing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Practical notes for this notebook\n",
    "- We aim for clear, well-documented code; each decision is justified by what we observe in the data and by standard data-cleaning best practices.\n",
    "- No analysis is performed here; the goal is to produce a clean, consistent, and well-typed dataset ready for downstream analysis."

    "\n",
    "Based on inspection and data-cleaning best practices, we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Standardize column names to `snake_case` for consistency and easier downstream use.\n",
    "2) Remove exact duplicate rows to avoid double-counting.\n",
    "3) Trim whitespace from textual columns and normalize casing where appropriate.\n",
    "4) Parse date-like columns (e.g., containing `date`/`jour`) to datetime for reliable time operations.\n",
    "5) Convert numeric-like columns currently stored as text to numeric with safe coercion.\n",
    "6) Handle missing values:\n",
    "   - Drop rows missing essential identifiers (e.g., liaison/line/date) if present.\n",
    "   - For count-like fields (e.g., number of delays/canceled services), impute 0 only when semantically sound.\n",
    "   - For categorical reason fields, set missing to `Unknown` and normalize labels.\n",
    "7) Persist a clean dataset to `data/processed` (CSV and Parquet if available) for reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "We document each decision inline below and rely on column-name heuristics when the schema varies (robustness without hard-coding unknowns)."
